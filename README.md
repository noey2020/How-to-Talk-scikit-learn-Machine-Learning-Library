We've had an incredible mathematical tour of machine learning. We learned about data, and how to derive parameters representing out data by loss functions or least square regression. We rewrote the summation loss function into matrix vector format as in: Wtranspose dot product X. W is the coefficient matrix while the X is feature vector. When there multiple dimensions for feature we created covariance, correlation matrices. We analyze correlation between features, rank the and select and extract.

We talked about optimizing loss functions and the many tools at our disposal.

Now we venture forward with scikit-learn. Now thanks to an active Python community of developers. We don't have to write data science from scratch. From the a very
code snippet , we can use optimized algorithms written in Fortran and C.

What we'll do is take a look at the scikit-learn API, which, as mentioned, combines a user-friendly and consistent interface with a highly 
optimized implementation of several classification algorithms. The scikit-learn library offers not only a large variety of learning algorithms,
but also many convenient functions to preprocess data and to fine-tune and evaluate our models.

for example this code snippet will perform modeling:

from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron

ppn = Perceptron(eta0=0.1, random_state=1)

ppn.fit(X_train_std, y_train)

I include some jupyter notebooks to serve as refreshers.

I included some posts for reference.
