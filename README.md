Hire me! ðŸ˜Š

We've had an incredible mathematical our of machine learning. We talked about optimizing loss functions and the many tools at our disposal.

Now we venture forward with scikit-learn. Now thanks to an active Python community of developers. We don't have to write data science from scratch. From the a very
code snippet , we can use optimized. witten in fortan and c .

for example

from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron

ppn = Perceptron(eta0=0.1, random_state=1)

ppn.fit(X_train_std, y_train)

I include some jupyter notebooks to serve as refreshers.

I included some posts for reference.
